# Curvetopia - A Journey into the World of Curves

Welcome to Curvetopia! This project is dedicated to the identification, regularization, and enhancement of various curves within 2D Euclidean space, with a particular focus on closed curves.

## Objective

Our mission is to bring order and aesthetic appeal to curves by:

**Identifying Regular Shapes:** Recognizing straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and star shapes.

**Exploring Symmetries:** Detecting reflection and rotational symmetries in closed shapes.

**Completing Incomplete Curves:** Seamlessly filling gaps in curves caused by occlusions.

## Problem Statement

Curvetopia aims to transform polylines representing line art into a set of regularized curves. Our key focus areas include:

**Regularizing Curves:** Identifying and correcting straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and star shapes.

**Exploring Symmetry:** Identifying and analyzing reflectional and rotational symmetries in closed shapes.

**Completing Incomplete Curves:** Closing gaps in curves to ensure they are continuous and aesthetically pleasing.

## Installation Requirements

To run this project, you need Python installed along with the following libraries:

**numpy:** For numerical operations and array handling.

**matplotlib:** For plotting and visualizing shapes and curves.

**svgwrite:** For creating and exporting SVG files.

**cairosvg:** For converting SVG files into other formats like PNG.

## Expected Results

By the end of this project, you should expect:

**Regularization:** The identification and correction of shapes, making them conform to regular geometric forms and symmetries.

**Curve Completion:** Closed curves that are completed naturally, ensuring a seamless and polished appearance.
